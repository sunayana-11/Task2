Tasks Performed :-

1. Data Loading and Cleaning

Loaded superstore_sales.csv using Pandas.

Standardized column names.

Converted Order Date and Ship Date to datetime format.

Used line Plots to compare sales and profit.


3. Avoided Clutter and Overuse of Colors

Disabled gridlines and avoided 3D visuals.

Focused on clear labels and clean layouts.



4. Highlighted Key Takeaways

Used annotations and data labels to emphasize key insights (e.g., loss in specific regions).

Identified top customers, profitable categories, and delay patterns.



5. Added Context to Charts

Each chart includes a descriptive title and labeled axes.

Legends and tooltips help interpret visuals.

Filters and groupings used to add context (like per region/year).



6. Focused on Business Insights

Interpreted visual results to answer real business questions:

Which regions are underperforming?

What products are most profitable?

How shipping affects delivery speed?




7. Created a Summary Slide (Notebook Section)
